# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?
The accuracy of the model's linear regression line, ranging from 1 (perfect) to 0 (terrible)


2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 42 years old?
137.15
3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?

I think that it is comfortably accurate for our learning purposes, but not for anyone who actually needs to knwo their blood pressure. The fact that the predicted value changes every time you run the program is evidence enough of this, which could be improved by training with more data.
