# Part 5 - Unsupervised Learning Writeup

After completing `a6_part5.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. Develop a name for each customer group based on the information from the graph. For example, one group might be called “Frugal” while another might be called “Shopaholic.” Explain your reasoning for each label.

- top left: stupid spenders, they spend a lot and don't make a lot.
- bottom left: frugal financeers, they don't make a lot so they don't spend a lot. 
- top right: boasting ballers, they make a lot and spend a lot.
- bottom right: smart savers, they make a lot of money but don't spend it. 
- middle: average acquisitive, they average out their normal spending with their normal income

2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?

The smart savers. (bottom right, the data from there kinda bleeds into the middle)

3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group?

The bottom right, people who don't spend as much money as they could. I've grown up around a lot of these people (my parents, etc.) and the one thing that always gets them is when companies advertise their products as "buy it for life", since it has the appeal of both preventing wastefulness and getting to save money down the line.
